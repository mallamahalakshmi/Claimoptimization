A modular, AI-powered system recommends the best settlement amounts for insurance claims. It takes into account legal costs, customer satisfaction, fraud risk, and long-term customer value to balance company profit and customer loyalty.

Features
Predictive Models for:

Legal Costs

Settlement Amounts

Customer Satisfaction Scores

Optimization Engine:

Minimizes total cost = settlement + legal cost - retention benefit.

Uses Scipy's minimize() for better decision-making.

Recommendation Engine:

Provides settlement advice: Settle Early vs Negotiate or Litigate.

Modular Design for flexibility and scalability.

Fully self-contained with synthetic claim data generation.

Project Structure
```bash
üìÅ claims-optimization/

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                # Project overview
```
How It Works
Input:
A claim case with attributes like:
```python
example_claim = {
    'claim_amount': 85000,
    'legal_complexity': 4,
    'customer_tenure': 5,
    'prior_claims': 1,
    'fraud_probability': 0.25,
    'customer_value': 2
}
```
Output:
```
--- Claim Settlement Recommendation ---
Claim Amount: 85000
Recommended Settlement: 61023.54
Predicted Legal Cost: 15450.12
Predicted Satisfaction: 0.83
Strategy: Settle Early
```
